        ("Captain_Stahl","Something in between; it's a long story. I worked for the Exploratory Service for many years, but currently I'm doing business for myself. I saw you got a new ship, and thought you might be interested in some work."),
        ("Burrows","Possibly. What kind of work?"),
        ("Captain_Stahl","My business associates and I are currently trying to expand business around Troy. Since pirate assaults have become more frequent we want to introduce better ships, and not just for Merchant Guild affiliates."),

        ("Captain_Stahl","The ES has chosen Helen in this system as the headquarters for this project. It is a hotspot area, where lightly-armed merchants encounter a lot of pirates. The ES board of directors thinks that business opportunities are the best around here, and they want Helen to be prepared for the boom. The Achilles base governor has pledged a capital investment in the form of gems that our company will deposit at a bank in Helen as collateral for a line of credit. We will use that credit to order a starting stock of TarsusMk2 for the show room - as soon as the diamonds are safe in Helen."),

        ("Burrows","Excuse me, but that's a ridiculous payment. If I wanted to make so little money, I could find a job as a male nurse on good old Earth. Tell me why I shouldn't just take those gems and run away?"),
